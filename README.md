# LJK Gas Safe - Plumbing & Heating Services

## Project Description

## Motivation & Development Context
This website was developed as a direct requirement from a client for their plumbing business. What makes this project particularly significant is that it represents my first complete website built from scratch, leveraging both my growing coding knowledge and the assistance of generative AI tools throughout the development process.
